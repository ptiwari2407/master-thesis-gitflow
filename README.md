### master-thesis-gitflow: Analysis Branch

Analysis Section contain analysis of Wordnet on extraction of single-lemma or multi-lemma synset. This is done at step-1.

Further on Step 2, we observe the *Hypernymy-hyponymy* structure of the wordnet to generate **lists of lemma that belong together to a synset or to its vicinity**.

After the steps above, pair of words are extracted which will be used in **Develop Branch** for similairity analysis by Word-embeddings model.
