## Emphasis is to show future employers software development through gitflow
There are 3 brances for this small project that I am doing as a part of my master's Thesis

2. Develop
3. Analysis

Master branch stores the merged final output that has been analyzed for completion of my thesis. Develop brnach has some merge to Master branch based on few commits finally merged.
Analysis includes preliminary analysis that was done before statrting this data-science project. Also some analysis done in middle is stored in analysis branch.
